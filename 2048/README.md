## Instructions for gameplay

You can move the tiles in four directions : up, down, left, and right. All numbers on the game board will slide into that direction until they hit the end of the board. 
 if they bump into each other then two numbers will be combined into one if they have the same value. Each number will only be combined once per move. Every move a new number 2 or 4 appears. If you have a 2048 on the board you have won, but you lose once the board is full and you cannot make a move.
