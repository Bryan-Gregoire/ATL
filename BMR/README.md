Basal metabolic rate is calculated based on gender, age, height and weight. This is an easy way to determine the daily calorie requirement necessary for an individual's survival at rest.
After calculation of the BMR, your activity level is then factored. The result is an estimate of how much energy (in calories) your body needs on a daily basis, when it is at rest.
