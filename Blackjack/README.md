## Overview

This is a java based console application which implements the black jack game.
Run using Maven

## Design Pattern

For the realization of this project, the use of the MVC pattern (Model View Controller) proved essential.

The application uses the maven as it's build and dependency management tool. To run the application using maven perform the steps below:

We noticed that the game always followed the same pattern which is:

- A distribution phase
- A decision phase for each player as well as for the dealer who plays it last
- finally, for the player, we determine if he has won or lost his winnings according to his cards and those of the dealer.

The player is faced with 2 choices to take his turn:
-	
- request a card.
- To skip the turn.
